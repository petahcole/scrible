This is a daily writing web app. Scrible populates a writing prompt
based on the type of piece you want to write. Writing every day is an important
part of developing your skills as a writer. Blank screen syndrome is especially
potent for writers. This app attempts to provide a creative kick-in-the-pants.

A prompt is provided if you want to write poetry and a prompt + character name
is provided if you want to write a story. There are also word count constraints 
for those wanting to challenge themselves.

An archive is dynamically populated via localStorage so you can read what you've
previously written.
